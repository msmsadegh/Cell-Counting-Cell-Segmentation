###Abstract:

Pretrained neural network models for biological segmentation can provide good out-of-the-box results for many image types. 
However, such models do not allow users to adapt the segmentation style to their specific needs and can perform suboptimally for test images
that are very different from the training images. Here we introduce Cellpose 2.0, a new package that includes an ensemble of diverse pretrained 
models as well as a human-in-the-loop pipeline for rapid prototyping of new custom models. We show that models pretrained on the Cellpose dataset 
can be fine-tuned with only 500–1,000 user-annotated regions of interest (ROI) to perform nearly as well as models trained on entire datasets with up to 200,000 ROI.
A human-in-the-loop approach further reduced the required user annotation to 100–200 ROI, while maintaining high-quality segmentations. 
We provide software tools such as an annotation graphical user interface, a model zoo and a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate 
the adoption of Cellpose 2.0.

###Main
Biological cell images vary extensively due to diverse microscopy techniques, tissue types, and labeling methods. 
Automated segmentation methods struggle with this diversity, often failing when applied to new types of data.
While high-performance segmentation methods exist, they rely on large training datasets and neural networks,
facing challenges in generalizing to out-of-distribution data. Addressing this, the study explores adapting 
neural network segmentation models to new image categories with minimal training data. The developed approach proves 
necessary, efficient, and effective, accommodating varied annotation styles and achieving accuracy similar to human experts.
The study utilizes large-scale datasets, Cellpose, and a model zoo, providing a user-friendly human-in-the-loop pipeline for rapid model adaptation.
